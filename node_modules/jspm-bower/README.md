# Bower endpoint

This is a bower endpoint for jspm.

To install a package just reference it by the package name, for example:

```shell
jspm install bower:jquery@1.9.1
```

Will install jquery version `1.9.1`. You can also require packages and use them directly in your code:

```javascript
var gazel = require('bower:gazel');
```
